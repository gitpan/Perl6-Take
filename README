Perl6-Take

Perl 6 provides the "gather" and "take" keywords to construct a list in a free manner.

Instead of:

    sub sorted_pairs {
        my %somehash = @_;
        my @pairs;
        for my $key (sort keys %somehash);
            push @out, [ $key => $somehash{$key} ];
        }
        return @pairs;
    }

You can say (in Perl 5 syntax):

    sub sorted_pairs {
        my %somehash = @_;
        gather { for my $key (sort keys %somehash);
            push @out, [ $key => $somehash{$key} ];
        }}
    }

(The difference is more marked in Perl 6 syntax all around.)
